The file names indicate the sample the data came from.
example names:

pm-N12-t1_S8.trim_bismark_bt2.bismark.cov.gz 

'pm' indicates the library was created with zymo's Pico Methyl kit
'L5' or 'N12' indicates the colony, Little Pioneer Bay 5 or Northeast Orpheus 12
's2' or 't1' indicates the tissue type (side or tip) and the replicates (1,2,or 3)
